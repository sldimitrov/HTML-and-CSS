    <p>On September 7, 1996 at 11:15 p.m. Tupac Shakur,
        a 25-year old American rapper, was fatally shot in a drive-by
        hooting in the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada. The shooting occurred
        when the car carrying Shakur was stopped at a red light at East
        Flamingo Road and Koval Lane.</p>
    
    <p>
        Shakur was struck by four rounds fired from a .40-calibre Glock-
        two in the chest, one in the arm, and one in the thigh.
        He died from his wounds six days later.

        On September 29, 2023, 27 years later, Duane "Keefe D" Davis
        was arrested after being indicted by a grand jury for the
        first-degree murder of Tupac Shakur.
